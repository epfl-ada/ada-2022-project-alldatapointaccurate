After obversing the gender distribution in graph G and G100, we can find that there are only eight females in the Top100 actors, which shows that in social network of actors the male actors occupy the absolute main force."

The p-value of T-test for the average height of male between Top100 and all actors is **0.61**, which shows that they are different in fact. So we can find that for female actors, who are in Top100 are usualy taller, but for male actors, who are in Top100 almost the same as the average or even shorter than average. It is a fact that taller people are more likely to become an actor or appear in the movies. Furtherly we can make a conclusion that Society has broad height requirements for male actors, but it often has higher requirements for women."
